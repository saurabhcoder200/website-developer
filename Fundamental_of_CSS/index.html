        Space, in a general sense, refers to the boundless, three-dimensional expanse that contains all matter and
        energy. It's
        often used as shorthand for outer space, which is the region beyond Earth's atmosphere. Outer space is
        characterized by
        extremely low particle density and pressure, essentially a vacuum, and the absence of breathable air and light
        scattering.

    <p>Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.[1] In classical physics, physical
        space is
        often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a
        boundless
        four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.[2] The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental
        importance to
        an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it
        is
        itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.</p>
