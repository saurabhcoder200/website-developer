                <h2>Facts about Instagram</h2>
                <p><strong>Instagram 📸 is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world today, but many people don’t know its
                fascinating background. It was created in just eight weeks ⏱️ by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger and launched in 2010 🚀.
                Originally called "Burbn", it later shifted focus to photo sharing and was renamed Instagram. In 2012, just two years
                after its release, Facebook (now Meta) 💼 purchased Instagram for $1 billion 💰, even though the app had only 13
                employees 👥 at that time.
                
                Today, Instagram has over 2 billion active monthly users 🌍 and continues to grow rapidly. Interestingly, India 🇮🇳 is
                now the largest user base, with over 300 million users, followed by the United States 🇺🇸 and Brazil 🇧🇷. The platform
                is especially popular among young people 👦👧, particularly those aged 18 to 34. In 2016, Instagram introduced the
                “Stories” feature 🎞️, inspired by Snapchat. Now, over 500 million people use Instagram Stories every day 📲, making it
                one of the app’s most used features.
                
                One surprising fact is that the most-liked photo on Instagram is a simple image of an egg 🥚, posted by the account
                @world_record_egg, which has received more than 60 million likes ❤️. Instagram has also become a major tool for
                businesses 🏪, with over 200 million business accounts on the platform. From global brands to local shops, many use
                Instagram for marketing 📢 and customer engagement 🤝. In addition, the rise of Instagram influencers 💃🧑‍💼 has turned
                the platform into a full-time profession for many, who can earn lakhs or even crores per post 💸 by promoting products.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Instagram’s feed is powered by algorithms 🤖 and artificial intelligence 🧠, meaning the posts you see are based on your
                interests, activity, and engagement, not the order in which they were posted. Another cool feature is Instagram’s photo
                filters 🎨, which were a major reason for its early popularity. These filters made it easy to edit and enhance photos 📷
                without needing extra apps.
                
                In conclusion, Instagram is no longer just a photo-sharing app, it’s a global platform for entertainment 🎭, business
                💼, communication 💬, and culture 🌐. Whether you’re scrolling for fun, promoting your brand, or discovering trends,
                Instagram continues to play a huge role in our digital lives. But Instagram isn’t just for selfies 🤳 and food pics 🍕 — it’s a powerful tool for business 💼 and influencers 🌟. Over
                200 million brands 🏢 use Instagram to promote their products, while influencers earn money through sponsored content
                💵. Its smart AI algorithm 🤖 shows users posts based on their interests. And guess what? The most-liked post ever is a
                photo of an egg 🥚 with over 60 million likes ❤️! From viral trends 🚀 to online shopping 🛒, Instagram has changed the
                way we connect, create, and communicate in the digital age 🌐.</strong></p>
